This is the java program for solving MDP with value iteration and policy iteration.

The 'classes' directory has the compiled .class files. 'src' is for original .java files. I also put the Jama.1.0.3.jar here
as it will be used to solve linear Bellman equations.

To run it from command line:

1.	If you want to use a .txt file to input a grid world (the format must be exactly the same as test.txt there), 
the most convenient way would be name it as test.txt and replace my original test.txt there (Under MDP directory, 
parallel with src, classes and jar). 

2.	Go into classes directory in your terminal/cmd.

3.	Type “java -cp ../jar/Jama-1.0.3.jar:./ Main” to run the program. The default path for input file is in the main function, 
so if your test.txt file is already there, no parameter needed here. Note that on Windows, I think the “:” should be replaced 
with “;” for setting up multiple class paths. 

4.	If the input file is somewhere else in your computer, the input should be “java -cp ../jar/Jama-1.0.3.jar:./ Main $path”. 
$path here is the absolute path of the input file on your computer.

5.	In case the program cannot read the input file properly, you can manually test the ValueIteration and PolicyIteration. They
both have a main function with a grid world.

Just type “java ValueIteration” or “java -cp ../jar/Jama-1.0.3.jar:./ PolicyIteration” respectively.
