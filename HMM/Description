Consider acasinogame, where the dealer is a three-sided dice with labels 1, 2, and 3. The dealer has threeloaded dice D1,D2 D3.
For die Di, the probability of rolling the number j is pij. At each turn, the dealer must decide whether to:  (1) keep the same
die; (2) switch to one of the other two dice randomly. She chooses (1) with probability p and (2) with probability 1-p. At the 
beginning the dealer chooses any of 3 dice with equal probability.



Expected Output
•Give an HMM for this situation. Specify the states, the transition probabilities and the emission probabilities. 

•Suppose that you observe the following sequence of die rolls: X.  Find a sequence of states which best explains the sequence 
of rolls. What is the probability of this sequence?
