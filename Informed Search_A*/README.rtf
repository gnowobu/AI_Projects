This folder contains .java and .class file for A* algorithm.
To run the program, please strictly follow the input format: 
java Astar StartVertex EndVertex e.txt v.txt. StartVertex and EndVertex are Integers representing vertices.

In case there are issues related to reading the txt file, you can just remove all the scripts in those txt file, just leave the numbers(normally this will not occur).

There's a e.txt and v.txt file in this folder for you to test the program.
